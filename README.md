# Survival ML Models

This repository contains code for survival prediction using explainable machine learning models.  
The analysis was conducted on the cancer dataset, focusing on predicting survival outcomes for cancer patients.

## Features
- Preprocessing of the dataset
- Survival prediction using multiple ML models
- Model explainability using SHAP and LIME
